Overview of the Project:

Grooming Easy is an innovative e-commerce platform that bridges the gap between consumers and salons. Recognizing that grooming is a vital aspect of our lives and addressing an unmet demand, we set out to simplify the process of finding the perfect salon that caters to individual needs.
With Grooming Easy, customers can explore various grooming options, including hairstyles, beard styles, hair colors, and the latest trends, all through the power of AI and VR visualization. Our platform allows users to visualize their chosen styles, making the decision process easier and more informed.
Once a style is selected, customers can effortlessly locate nearby salons within a few kilometers, book appointments, and place orders as needed. Grooming Easy ensures that the path to personal style and grooming is convenient, seamless, and tailored to every individual's preferences.
